    <h2> My Profile</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="profilepicsmall.jpg" alt="image of Heather Bowden" style="float:left;">
        <b>Name:</b> Heather Ann Bowden.

        <b>Something about me:</b> I have an elderly ragdoll cat called Crystal. She has travelled everywhere with me as I believe a pet is for life. From Australia she went to New Zealand, then Malaysia, Singapore, back to Australia and now back in Singapore! Last year during the Singapore lockdown she developed a tumour. All very stressful – the vet had to ask the government for permission to treat her (the rules were life threatening situations only) and there were delays in pathology as samples had to be sent to Hong Kong for analysis. But she is all good now!

    <h2> Interest in IT</h2>

    <ul class="dottype">
        <li>I am not sure when I became interested in IT. In technology I was always interested. I broke my leg when I was four, playing “space men”. I started my IT career by gaining a traineeship as a “Communications Officer” with the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV), based in the Latrobe Valley. Most things there I delt with there were robust not electronic. Electronic devices had to be protected from magnetic fields – isolation or agon gas, coal dust (conductive) – pressurization, and changing earth potentials – mercury switches. I then worked at Memorex-Telex on mainframe peripheral equipment. Moved on to QANTEK, working on telecommunications, mainframe peripheral equipment, Netware servers, routers and switching equipment. I then worked for various financial institutions on routing and switching. Lastly working for EDS which evolved to what became DXC on routing, switching and application delivery controllers (ADC).</li>
        <li>I chose to come to RMIT as they offer a Bachelor of Technology through Open University Australia. This suited me as I was not sure where in the world I would be over the time it takes to complete the degree. I am hoping to complete this degree and then obtain my masters in IT security.</li>
        <li>In my studies I am hoping to learn some programming skills as network devices are becoming more programable via common programming languages. I am also hoping to improve my written and leadership skills as my formal training has mostly been purely technical.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Ideal Job</h2>
    <h3>Cybersecurity Lead - Advisor at AGL</h3>
    <p>

        My “Ideal Job” would be involved in Cybersecurity. This role is a management role that leads a cybersecurity department. This role interested me in that it is not just about the technology, its about interacting with various people including those affected by security not just fellow technical workers. It also attracts me because it is with a high value target from a security point of view, hence the work should be valued and not thought of something just to do, to meet minimum legal requirements. It is a role about implementing processes and education. It is not just about educating the general staff and partners, but also the security staff about how to minimise risk while still allowing the general staff, partners, and customers to be able achieve their goals efficiently.
        The position requires either experience or qualifications (not specified), in risk management, IT and telecommunications security, IT and telecommunications policy. It requires a management background that is corporate and experience as a security consultant.
        I have a corporate network background, working often for financial institutions, hence I have experience of PCI compliance, security audit compliance, security appliances such as web firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), virtual private networks (VPN), hardware security modules (HSM), and application delivery controllers (ADC).
        I am lacking the process skills, after completing a Bachelor of Technology, I am hoping to complete my masters in IT security. From there I may try to gain some certifications such as CRMA and/or CISSP while working in a more junior security role.

    <h3> My Learning Style</h3>
    <p>
        The Oxford Learning College test is like a bridge between personaltity and learning styles
        <a href="https://www.oxfordcollege.ac/learning-type-quiz/"> Learning Type Quiz</a>
        My results were
        Reflector
        Reflectors like to observe from many different perspectives. They collect data, both firsthand and from others, and prefer to think about it thoroughly before coming to any conclusion. The thorough collection and analysis of data about experiences is what counts, so they tend to postpone definitive conclusions for as long as possible. They are thoughtful people who would like to consider all possible angles and implications before making a move. They prefer to take a back seat in meetings and discussions. They enjoy observing other people in action. They listen to others and get the drift of the discussion before making their own points. They tend to adopt a low profile and have a slightly distant, tolerant, unruffled air about them. When they act it is part of a large picture which includes the past as well as the present and others’ observations as well as their own.
        Strengths of a Reflector
        • Careful
        • Thorough and methodical
        • Thoughtful
        • Good at listening to others and assimilating information.
        • Rarely jump to conclusions

        • BLUE: Planning
        • YELLOW: Administrating

        Your Interest
        "Interests" describe the types of activities that you are drawn to; these will need to be present in a job or career that you are considering if you are to stay motivated. It is important to note that interest in an activity does not necessarily indicate skill.
        • RED
        People with red interests like hands-on / problem solving job responsibilities and professions that involve practical, technical, and objective activities. Red Interests include: building, implementing, organizing, producing, and delegating, which often lead to work in manufacturing, managing, directing, small business owning, and surgery.
        Your Style
        "Style" describes the strengths that you could bring to a work environment when you are at your best. This is the way you like to get results. A work environment in which your strengths are appreciated is a big part of career satisfaction.
        • BLUE
        People with blue styles prefer to perform their job responsibilities in a manner that is supportive and helpful to others with a minimum of confrontation. They prefer to work where they have time to think things through before acting. People with blue style tend to be insightful, reflective, selectively sociable, creative, thoughtful, emotional, imaginative, and sensitive. Usually, they thrive in a cutting edge, informally paced, future-oriented environment. You will want to choose a work environment or career path in which your style is welcomed and produces results.

    <h3> Test Summary</h3>
    <p>
        The results showed a theme, I like to plan and organise after taking in the ideas and views of others. That I have an attention to detail. The word “reflective” appears a few times in the quiz results.
        There was some interesting detail in the sixteen personalities where it says I like rules and structure.
        The learning survey shows why I have difficulty in recalling detail from telephone calls where I have not written down notes. I think the writing may be the “doing” and then I “visually” learn it when I read the information.
        The career survey shows that you cannot take these things too seriously, I cannot see me taking up being a baseball player! But it did have a few IT careers in there, and that I should look at something that creates “something”.
        I think the results may show what duties in a team I would be the most motivated in. Creating the structure, the rules on how the project should progress, or maybe verifying the results – the quality control.
        It would be nice to have a mix of personalities in a team where everyone has a position in which they feel the most comfortable and rewarded by being utilised on their strengths. It could also be used to avert weaknesses by placing opposing types together to create a tempered result.

    <h2> Project Idea</h2>
    <h3> Pop down the shops Andriod application</h3>
    <p>
        This is an app that has three location bases, Home, Work, and Roam. It shows you the small businesses within a 1km radius or the nearest strip of shops. The idea being that it is just a plain list of business names and type, that you can contact via phone or WhatsApp by pressing the button of that business. No distraction of advertisements, ratings, or search engine ranking bias. The application will have minimal interaction, the user should be able to find the business simply and it should have a non-cluttered appearance for quick recognition.
    </p>
    <h3> Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes you are out and about, and you get a call. Suddenly you need to plan something such as a BBQ or get your hair done at short notice. You just want to ring your local shops, to see if they have that many steaks or you can make an appointment for today, but you do not want to be, finding your reading glasses and typing stuff in (can you remember the business name of the local butcher?), only to get all the chain stores as results. For businesses it helps with “shop local” and helps them to compete with minimal technical interaction.
    </p>
    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p>
    Client side:
The Android application will open with the location choice of Home, Work or Roam. Each button has a simple logo representing the choice as well as the wording. A drop down, side menu represented by a hamburger icon will give options for location setting, help and “Contact US”.
By pressing the Home, Work or Roam location button, the GPS details are sent to the server for matching against the data base. On a successful match the screen is updated with a list of business types available. The business types are also represented by a logo and wording. Examples would be fresh food, restaurants, fitness.  By pressing on a business type button, a list of matching businesses will be displayed.
Pressing on the business button will provide a choice of available contact options. For example, a butcher may only want a phone contact while a clothing store would want a video connection to show what is available. A map button is also provided.
Server side:
A database server where each business has the following fields. GPS location, business type, business id, business name, business address, contact choice one, contact choice two.
An initial request to the application server consists of the GPS co-ordinates of the location choice of the client with the business type being of value zero. With the business type being zero the server makes a database query of only the business types in a GPS co-ordinate range close to the given GPS co-ordinates. The server then rejects the duplicate matches and sends a list of business type buttons matching the request.
When the user presses a business type button the location choice GPS co-ordinates are again sent but this time with the business type value. The server then makes another search with the addition of the business type value. All matching businesses are returned displaying the business name and address.

The client now chooses a business button – the business id is sent, and the server returns the store’s GPS co-ordinates and contact choices. If the client presses the map button the co-ordinates are sent to Google maps and a map page opens. If the client presses a phone number the number is dialled or if they press WhatsApp contact the store is contacted via WhatsApp if the client has the WhatsApp installed.
On every app page there is a Home button to take you back to the initial page.
The hamburger drop-down menu has a help page with instructions on how to use the application.
A set location menu where you can choose Home or Work and press store, to save the GPS co-ordinates of where you currently are.
And finally, a “Contact us” where the client can provide feedback on the application or report issues with the validity of the shop data and a usage agreement.
The style of the application will be plain using text that is easy to read, and colours that help define choices but are friendly to people with vision issues.
    </p>
    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p>
        The software is designed to use on Android smart phones. It will need Android studio to create the application. An Android emulator such as Genymotion, to inspect that the application runs and displays correctly on different screen sizes. A cloud server such as AWS and a cloud database such as MongoDB to host the application, tutorials, and business data. A proto-type tool such as Invision to work out screen graphics and movement between screen pages. To make the tutorials a video editor such as Openshot is needed and a PC with the componentry to cope.
    </p>
    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    <p>
        To make the application, the following skills are required: Knowledge on how to create an Android application, how to create a database. This will require knowledge on a programming language. How to create prototypes and what colours, styles work well on mobile phones. How does one engage cloud services? What needs to be known in resources? There are free cloud services, but the downside is reliability, security, and sizing.
To make the tutorials, video editing skills are required, but there are many free editors.
To engage with businesses, to have the contacts that will reach into the community such as the local council or business association.
    </p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>
        If the project is successful the application will have businesses listed in many areas. People will find the application easy and quick to use and be able to support their local community by shopping local. It will help local business be able to reach their local customers by providing better customer service by having an alternative way of being contactable. It will not be a platform that penalises the business by having a low digital footprint, because they have a low number of “hits”.
